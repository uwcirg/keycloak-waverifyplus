		<p>Welcome to the Digital COVID-19 Verification Record system. WA Verify is a free tool
			that can
			be
			used to
			access your digital COVID-19 verification record. Enter a few details below to
			get a
			link to a
			QR code
			and digital copy of your COVID-19 verification record. If you want to share
			proof of
			vaccination, you
			can use either the electronic or a printed version of the record youâ€™ll get from
			the
			system. We
			recommend waiting 3-7 days for your new dose to show up in the Immunization
			Registry
			before
			requesting a
			link. The link expires 24 hours after it is sent, so please save, download, or
			print
			your
			record.</p>
		<p>People within a family may have multiple verification records associated with a
			single phone
			number
			or email
			address, enter each digital verification record request separately.</p>
		<p>The system provides a digital copy of state vaccine records. If you received your
			vaccinations from a
			federal
			agency (Department of Defense, Indian Health Services, or Veterans Affairs), you
			will
			need to
			contact
			those agencies for assistance.</p>
