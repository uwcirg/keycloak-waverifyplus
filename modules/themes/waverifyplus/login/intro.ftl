		<p>Welcome to WA Verify+, a free tool being developed by the WA State Department of Health (DOH) that
			can be used to build
			your health summary and share that summary as you see fit, under your control. You might want to
			have a summary for
			emergency use, to share with new providers, to have a complete immunization record, or to use
			with new personal health
			applications. The health summary can use computerized health record data from your health care
			providers (which the
			US Federal 21st Century Cures Act gives you the right to do), information such as advance
			directives and occupational
			health which choose to enter and share, and some information from WA State DOH, such as your
			immunization data.
			You choose what and how you share. You can create different summaries for different purposes,
			give them expiration
			dates, and attach passcodes, if you wish. Each summary has their own internet link and QR code.
			Enter a few details
			below to get started.
		</p>
		<p>A note regarding immunizations: The system will provide a digital copy of state vaccine records. If
			you received
			your vaccinations from a federal agency (Department of Defense, Indian Health Services, or
			Veterans Affairs), you
			will need to contact those agencies for assistance.</p>
